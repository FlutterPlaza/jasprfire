## Continuous Integration ü§ñ

Jaspr Lucide Icons comes with a built-in [GitHub Actions workflow][github_actions_link] powered by [Very Good Workflows][very_good_workflows_link]. This workflow ensures your code is formatted, linted, and tested automatically on every pull request and push. The project uses [Very Good Analysis][very_good_analysis_link] for strict analysis options, and code coverage is enforced using [Very Good Workflows][very_good_coverage_link].

## Running Tests üß™

To run all unit tests and generate a coverage report:

```sh
dart pub global activate coverage 1.2.0
dart test --coverage=coverage
dart pub global run coverage:format_coverage --lcov --in=coverage --out=coverage/lcov.info
genhtml coverage/lcov.info -o coverage/
open coverage/index.html
```

## Example Project Structure üóÇÔ∏è

When integrating Jaspr Lucide Icons into your project, it's helpful to maintain a clear project structure. Here's an example of how you can structure your project files:

```
/your_project
|-- lib/
|   |-- components/
|   |   |-- header.dart
|   |-- pages/
|   |   |-- home.dart
|   |   |-- about.dart
|   |-- app.dart
|   |-- main.dart
|-- pubspec.yaml
|-- README.md
```

- **components/header.dart**: Contains reusable components like the header.
- **pages/home.dart**: Defines the homepage.
- **pages/about.dart**: Defines the about page with Lucide Icons.
- **app.dart**: The main application component where routes and global styles are defined.
- **main.dart**: The entry point for the application.

## Best Practices üìù

- **Optimize Performance**: Only include the icons you need and import them efficiently to keep the application performant. Use importLucideIcons(mode: Mode.production) in production;
- **Consistent Styling**: Use consistent styles across your components for a unified look and feel. You can define common styles in a shared `styles.dart` file and apply them across your components.
